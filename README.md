# Garbage Project: Image Recognition Model Training Pipeline
This repo has a CI/CD powered Pipeline to train my CNN for both Tensorflow and Pytorch Lightning frameworks on Cloud. 
With a help of [CML tool](cml.dev/) and GitHub Actions training code is transferring to Cloud GPU based machine instance and trains there.
With a help of [Neptune AI](neptune.ai/) I can track my training experiment logs and manage models.
